# Ignored Files
# ignored files don't get tracked in GitHub. Good for Sensitive info, personal notes or system files
# To take care of ignoring files, you can create .gitignore file at root level of project

# Create gitignore file and can add whatever we want to ignore in that file.

# Global gitignore file
## This is generally used in use cases where there are lot of projects.
# In such case if we want to update any onboarded new projects with specific ignore files then we use the below mention command
git config --global core.excludesfile <filename>   # this command will ignore/exclude the files mentioned in global ignore file.

#clearing the Cache
git rm -r --cached .
